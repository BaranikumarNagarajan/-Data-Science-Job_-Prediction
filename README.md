# Predictive Model for(Data-Science-Job_-Prediction)

This repository contains the code and analysis for building a predictive model using a dataset. The objective is to predict the target variable based on the input features using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict a target variable (e.g., churn prediction, customer classification, etc.) from a given dataset. The project involves several stages, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `[Data-Science-Job_-Prediction]`. It includes several features such as:

- Numerical columns: Age, Salary, etc.
- Categorical columns: Gender, Country, etc.
- Target column: `target` (the variable we aim to predict).

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
   - The `enrollee_id` column is removed as it's irrelevant for prediction.
   - Missing values are handled by imputing numerical columns with the median and categorical columns with the mode.

2. **Categorical Encoding**
   - Categorical features are encoded using `LabelEncoder`, which transforms categories into numerical values.

3. **Data Splitting**
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing) using `train_test_split`.

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Numerical features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

5. **Model Training**
   - A Random Forest Classifier is used to train the model. The classifier is set with 100 estimators and a maximum depth of 10.
   - The `class_weight='balanced'` parameter ensures that the model can handle class imbalance if present in the data.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - The model's performance is evaluated using:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Confusion Matrix**
     - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score for each class)
     - **ROC Curve** to visualize the trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.

7. **Feature Importance**
   - Feature importance values are extracted from the trained Random Forest model and visualized in a bar plot to identify the most influential features.

## Key Visualizations

- **Confusion Matrix**: A heatmap showing the true vs. predicted classifications.
- **Classification Report**: A bar plot of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Feature Importance**: A bar plot showing which features are most important in making predictions.
- **ROC Curve**: A plot of the modelâ€™s performance across various thresholds.
- **Learning Curve**: A plot of training accuracy and cross-validation accuracy against the training set size.
